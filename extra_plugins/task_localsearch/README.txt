This plugin implements a Tipue-based local search for your site.

To use it, copy task_localsearch.plugin and task_localsearch
into a plugins/ folder in your nikola site.

After you build your site, you will have several new files in assets/css and assets/js
and a search.html that you can use as a basis for using this in your site.

For more information about how to customize it and use it, please refer to the tipue
docs at http://www.tipue.com/search/
