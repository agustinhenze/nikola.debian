nikola (5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version is not completely backwards compatible, thus the new major
  version number, but switching to it should be easy-ish. If you are using
  version 4.0.3:
   - Remove your dodo.py
   - Use nikola build instead of doit from now on
   - Use nikola serve instead of doit serve, nikola new_post instead of doit
     new_post, and so on. Some other doit task are also converted into nikola
     command you can get the list using nikola help.
